Hi
----------------
Module development
----------------------
Functions -> we can call a function infinite times. It will give inputs and give us outputs

Write the code only once and call them many times -> Modules

Modules -> resource definition and arguemnts are same, only values are different

create one repo -> terraform-aws-ec2

ec2-module-demo -> here we use code in above folder by using module keyword

--------------------------------------------------
Provider will not be there in module

It will be in the file in while we refer the module
Provider will be present in the file where we call the module


We need to write a readme.md file in which we have to specify the mandatory, optional inputs and we only should write down the what are the outputs we get by using our specific module

We also can restrict the users on what inputs they can able to given

Advantages of using modules
----------------------------
Code reuse
updates are easy and centralised
best practices can be enforced
We can restrict the user using few options as per project standards

VPC-> Virtual Private Cloud
We do have data centers for every company in earlier days. Now a days less companies are mantaining own data centers.

Datacenters means locating all servers in one place.

Data centers are directly connected to Internet connection 

For example our business is taking restaurant orders

Needed:
physical space
buy servers
power connection
network connection
cooling
OS resources
Maintenance


We can make all these things by using cloud resource with cloud account

Keeping all these in cloud means it is an isolated datacenter in cloud. 

Resources created inside vpc is completely private

For villages pin codes are unique for every villages

Home -> House no.

vpc -> name, cidr
we do have some subnets
Private subnet, public subnet

In a village we have
Main entrance -> Public Relations -> Ministry -> PMO

Village name, pincode -> VPC name, cidr
Street name, number -> subnets name, cidr
Roads -> Route
Main road -> Internet connection, Internet gateway
Main gate of house -> Security group/firewall
House -> server

subnets are nothing but divisions

VPC -> expense
CIDR -> Classless InterDomain Routing

192.178.3.4 -> 4 octates
255.255.255.255 -> Max IP
10.0.0.0/16 -> cidr

Total IP address bits are 32. Possible IP addresses are 2^32

10.0.0.0/16 -> 1st 2 octates are blocked

10.0.0.1
10.0.0.2
.
.
.
10.0.0.255

10.0.1.0
10.0.2.0
.
.
10.0.255.0

2^16 => 65,536

Creating subnets-> expense-public and expense-private

10.0.0.0/24 -> 1st 3 octates blocked

10.0.0.1
.
.
10.0.0.255
Subnets possible
10.0.1.0/24 -> 10.0.1.0/24...10.0.255.0/24
10.0.2.0/24

10.0.1.0/24 -> public subnet
10.0.2.0/24 -> private subnet
10.0.3.0/24 -> database subnet

Internet gatway -> igw

Route table -> expense-public

Public route table will be linked with igw

public vs private subnet

subnet which has internet connection is called as public subnet. Private subnet will not have internet connection

database subnet is also called as private subnet

create route tables for expense-private subnet and database subnet

10.0.0.0/16 -> Internal roads

Private route tables have to be linked with private subnets

create vpc
create igw and associate with vpc
create public, private and database subnets
create public, private and database route tables
create routes inside the route table
associate route tables with appropriate subnets
create elastic IP
create NAT gateway
add NAT routes in private and database subnets


secure servers can not be reached directly to the public. this is incoming traffic/ingress

traffic from the servers -> outgoing traffic/egress

yum install nginx or mysql-server -> outgoing traffic
we are calling yum here

NAT gatway -> mechanism in which private servers connects to internet for outgoing traffic like packages installation, security patches downloads

Create elastic Ip
Create NAT gatway -> select public subnet -> attach elastic IP

NAT -> when server stops and starts IP address will change

NAT gateway should have same IP address that is called static IP/elastic IP

Private subnets should have route to connect with NAT gateway to reach Internet

Edit private route tables by connecting it to NAT gateway target to reach Internet
